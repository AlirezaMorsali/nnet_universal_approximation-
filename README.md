# Universal Approximation Theorem

The universal approximation theorem states that a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of R^n, under mild assumptions on the activation function [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem)
